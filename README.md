Once a proper sign up is completed, user will be sent a confirmation email to verify their account. Their password will be encrypted to preserve security as well: [1](https://i.imgur.com/2pHGFBO.png) [2](https://i.imgur.com/I4mXEJW.png) [3](https://i.imgur.com/ZGDVVES.png) [4](https://i.imgur.com/qiYywYD.png)
